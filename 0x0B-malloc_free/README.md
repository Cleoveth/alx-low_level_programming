* Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee - a function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char.
* The woman who has no imagination has no wings - a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory.
* He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life - a function that concatenates two strings.
* If you even dream of beating me you'd better wake up and apologize - a function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers.
* It's not bragging if you can back it up - a function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your alloc_grid function.
